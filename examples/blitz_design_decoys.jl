# In this example, we will attempt to launch N number of decoys of a simulation,
# evaluating the best decoy at the end. We can do this in serial mode (1
# simulation at a time), or in parallel, where multiple processors (even in
# multiple machines) do 1 simulation each one (at the same time) and the results
# are compared at the end, therefore speeding up the calculation time. In a
# single machine (running Ubuntu), the number of available threads can be found
# with the command: cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l

# (B) Simulation Stage: There are different approaches to spawn N jobs in the

# a remote machine, a RemoteChannel is employed, rather than a simple Channel.
# Set the number of replicas

# number of replicas is performed. This allows for equitable sharing of work
# between workers (1 simulation might take longer than the other, the rest of
# workers can take new jobs without synching among themselves).
