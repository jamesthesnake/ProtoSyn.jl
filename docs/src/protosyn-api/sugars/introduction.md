# Sugars

Besides the Core module, ProtoSyn comes with several other extra modules that build on top of and expand the base methods, types and submodules. These ProtoSyn modules are specific for a given topic. In the case of the [Sugars](@ref) module, all new or expanded methods and types explore the topic of carbohydrates simulation and ramified sugar structures, including glycoproteins. With this extra constraint, most methods can be especialized.

In sum, the [Sugars](@ref) module makes available several methods, types and submodules specific for ramified polysaccharide structures.
