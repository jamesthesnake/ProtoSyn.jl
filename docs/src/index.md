# Welcome to the ProtoSyn.jl documentation!
_[ProtoSyn.jl](https://github.com/sergio-santos-group/ProtoSyn.jl) is a platform
for molecular manipulation and simulation, with an emphasis on peptide design._


The main goal of ProtoSyn is to be a basis on top of which new tools and
protocols can be experimented and prototyped. Taking advantage of Juliaâ€™s
environment, ProtoSyn has been built with emergent technologies in mind, such as
distributed computing, GPU and SIMD acceleration and machine learning models
usage.

### Features
* Edit a peptide structure by removing, adding and mutating any number of residues
* Create peptides from scratch by providing the desired sequence
* Copy parts of other molecules and graft them together to create something new
* Run Monte Carlo simulations to optimize a structure or a sequence
* Calculate energies and forces using [TorchANI](https://github.com/aiqm/torchani) code, integrated in Julia.
* Perform Steepest Descent optimizations
* Explore rotamer libraries to optimize sidechain packaging
* Select residues based on name, index, distance and other parameters, with a rich combinatory selection syntax
* Perform rigid body docking of ligands

Version 1.0 is scheduled to be released in the end of 2021.
